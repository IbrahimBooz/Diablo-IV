                    <h2>Barbarian</h2>
                    <p>The Barbarian has unparalleled strength and expertly wields an entire arsenal in battle, with a
                        weapon for every occasion. He bellows intimidating war cries and unleashes ground-shaking slams
                        to send approaching hordes reeling."</p>

                    <p>Rogues are your nominal dexterity-based class, agile and nimble, speedily dashing to avoid
                        attacks or strike when least expected. Similar to characters from previous games like the Amazon
                        and Demon Hunter,
                        Rogues provide a mix of both melee and ranged expertise.</p>

                    <p>Necromancers tend to be a fan-favorite for long-time Diablo fans. It's partly because
                        of their background lore (i.e., they're Priests of Rathma), and their strengths.</p>

                    <p>The Diablo 4 Druid is a hybrid class. On one hand, they can do a bit of spellcasting,
                        as their communion with nature lets them call on the elements.</p>

                <h1>DIABLO IV</h1>
                <P>Seeking refuge from the eternal conflict between the High Heavens and the Burning Hells, Inarius and
                    Lilith formed Sanctuary and gave life to the Nephalem with the stolen Worldstone. Fearing for the
                    destruction of her hybrid offspring, Lilith led a violent, protective act to protect the Nephalem;
                    ultimately leading Inarius to turn his back on her, banishing her to the abyss, becoming enemies
                    henceforth.
                    Lilith’s return ushers in an age of darkness and misery. What fate awaits?</P>
